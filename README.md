Get Next Line was the third project I completed at **Hive** Helisinki. It was extremely challenging, but also very informative. I was introduced to the concept of "static variables" and the importance of protecting against memory leaks was made bare. 

### **Description**

We were instructed to produce a programme that behaves in the following way:

â€¢ Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a   time.

â€¢ Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing left to read or if an error occurs, it should return NULL.

Seems simple enough. It was not. ðŸ˜‚
